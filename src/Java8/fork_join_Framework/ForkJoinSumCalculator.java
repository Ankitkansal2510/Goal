/**
 * The fork/Join framework is used to design to recursively split parallelizable task into smaller subtask and then combine
 * the result of the each subtask to produce a final result.It's an implementation of the ExecutorService interface which
 * distributes those subtask to the worker thread in a thread pool ,known as ForkJoinPool.
 *
 * Working with recurseive Task
 *
 * To submit a task to this pool we have to create a subclass of RecursiveTask<R>, (where R is the result produced of the
 * recursive task and all its subtask).To define Recursive task we just need to implement one method
 *  protected abstract R compute().
 *
 *  This method defines the logic of both splitting a task into a subtask and the algorithm to produce the result of single
 *  subtask when it is not possible to further divide it.
 *
 *  Lets implement it

/**
 * When you pass the ForkJoinSumCalculator task to the ForkJoinPool, this task is executed by a thread of the pool that in turn calls the compute
 * method of the task. This method checks to see if the task is small enough to be performed sequentially; otherwise,
 * it splits the array of numbers to be summed into two halves and assigns them to two new ForkJoinSumCalculators that
 * are scheduled to be executed by the ForkJoinPool.As a result, this process can be recursively repeated, allowing the original
 * task to be divided into smaller tasks, until the condition used to check
 * if itâ€™s no longer convenient or no longer possible to further split it is met (in this case, if the number of items to be summed is less than
 * or equal to 10,000). At this point, the result of each subtask is computed sequentially, and the (implicit) binary tree of tasks created by
 * the forking process is traversed back toward its root
